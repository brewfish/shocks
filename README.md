# shocks

#This is the repository holding the raw production data and code used by Cottrell et al. to create global analyses of 'shocks' to food production data across land and sea. 
#Production data files are separated for crop, livestock, inland fisheries and marine fisheries, and aquaculture. The aquaculture file separates out Inland or Marine Areas as "Inland Water" or "Marine Areas". These have been used to divide the two in this analysis.
Within this are the shapefiles used from the Natural Earth shapefile downloads page https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/ to map data on country-level polygons.
The EEZ shapefiles were orginally sourced from marineregions.org (Flanders Marine Institute (2018). Maritime Boundaries Geodatabase, version 10. Available online at http://www.marineregions.org/.) but simplified due to incompatibilities with projections used for mapping in this paper.
